I further formed research questions by \ndataset features and researching the companies utilizing taxi industry domain knowledge to help assess the competition \nthrough KPIs like location, distance, and time.  \n\u2022 \nI produced 10+ visualizations including line graphs, bar-chart and heat-maps plots of Uber and Lyft and their KPI, using \nTableau and Python.
